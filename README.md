# <h1>Day 1 Task</h1>
# Two Sum <italic> Easy</italic>

# Rotate Array
Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.
For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to
[5,6,7,1,2,3,4].
# Day 5
Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
palindrome
, and false otherwise.

# Day 6
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.
